# AircraftClassifier
A tensorflow convolutional neural network to classify the variant of an aircraft based on an image. 

A personal project to further my knowledge of tensorflow and practice using django.

The model is accessed using a django backend (REST API) with a simple jquery/bootstrap front-end.
