# AircraftClassifier

A personal project to further my knowledge of tensorflow.

Attempts to classify aircraft variants based on a given image.

Note that the training sets + the output from the program (inc. the model packaged with graphs showing performance with regards to loss rate/accuracy vs training and test set) are not included in this repo due to the github file size limit.
